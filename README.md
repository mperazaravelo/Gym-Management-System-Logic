# Gym-Management-System-Logic
A project that I created for class CEN-3024C (Software Development I) at Valencia College to apply knowledge about the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process using Java programming language and logic
The objective of this project was develop the logic part of a more complex project that will become a program called the Gym Database Management System. This program perform basic actions like adding, removing, updating, and querying information from a list of gym employees. The user will be presented with a text menu that provides the choices he or she can make in the system, and the user will input a number representing that choice. For the first choice (adding employees from a file), the user will be also prompted to enter the path from a file that contains the information of employees previously formatted, and this information is printed on the screen. For the second choice, the user will enter the datails of each employee manually as per each prompt he or she receives. For the remove choice, the user will input an id number and the employee with that corresponding number in the program will be deleted. For the update choice, the user will be prompted to enter an id number to signal the record they want to update and the fields that they want to change, by using a menu. For last choice, the program will exit.
